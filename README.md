# learnR

This repo contains materials related to teaching "R programming for behavioral scientists" - taught by Prof Curley - UT Austin, Psychology, Fall 2017.

The materials are  designed to be used during class with instruction by Prof Curley, but can be read alone also.

  
    
      



## Weekly Material


### Week 1.  Introduction to R – Data Structures & Syntax

Aim: The first week will introduce the R programming language. Students will become familiar with basic programming concepts such as data structures, functions, and objects. Students will learn basic R syntax and become familiar with commonly used base R functions.

During the first class students will also take a background skills and knowledge questionnaire, as well as a values questionnaire where students will describe their thoughts related to how important they value particular concepts such as reproducibility and data visualization.

Reading: Please read Chapter 3-6 of R. Cotton, Learning R: A Step-by-Step Function Guide to Data Analysis, O’Reilly, 2013. 
 

 

### Week 2. Data Carpentry

Aim: Students will learn how to import and export data from RStudio. Students will learn how to summarize data and how to reorganize and work flexibly with raw data.

Reading: Chapter 5, 11 & 12 of G. Grolemund & H.Wickham, R for Data Science, O’Reilly, 2016. You can access this book online for free here:   http://r4ds.had.co.nz/

Please familiarize yourself  with the material. Don't worry if you get lost with the code - we will work through it together in class.  I would like you to get a sense of the purpose of being able to transform data in different ways using code.

After class, students will complete a data carpentry challenge to be submitted prior to class of week 3.

 

 

 

### Weeks 3-4   Data Visualization I & II

Aim: Students will learn how to visualize and explore data using the ggplot2 package. Students will become familiar with how to choose the most appropriate data visualization for different data types by adjust aesthetics and chart types. Students will learn Leland Wilkinson’s grammar of graphics approach to data visualization.

Before Class II (week4): Students will complete a makeover challenge assignment and submit prior to the class. This challenge will consist of a poor visualization of data that the students will be asked to improve or come up with different ways in which the data could be visually represented.
