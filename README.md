# learnR

This repo contains materials related to teaching _"R Programming for Behavioral Scientists"_ - taught by Prof Curley - UT Austin, Psychology, Fall 2017.

The materials are  designed to be used during class with instruction by Prof Curley, but can be read alone also.

## Weekly Material

<br/>

### Week 1.  Introduction to R – Data Structures & Syntax

Aim: The first week will introduce the R programming language. Students will become familiar with basic programming concepts such as data structures, functions, and objects. Students will learn basic R syntax and become familiar with commonly used base R functions.

During the first class students will also take a background skills and knowledge questionnaire, as well as a values questionnaire where students will describe their thoughts related to how important they value particular concepts such as reproducibility and data visualization.

Reading: Please read Chapter 3-6 of R. Cotton, Learning R: A Step-by-Step Function Guide to Data Analysis, O’Reilly, 2013. 
 
<br/>
 

### Week 2. Data Carpentry

Aim: Students will learn how to import and export data from RStudio. Students will learn how to summarize data and how to reorganize and work flexibly with raw data.

Reading: Chapter 5, 11 & 12 of G. Grolemund & H.Wickham, R for Data Science, O’Reilly, 2016. You can access this book online for free here:   http://r4ds.had.co.nz/

Please familiarize yourself  with the material. Don't worry if you get lost with the code - we will work through it together in class.  I would like you to get a sense of the purpose of being able to transform data in different ways using code.

After class, students will complete a data carpentry challenge to be submitted prior to class of week 3.

### Weeks 3-4   Data Visualization I & II

Aim: Students will learn how to visualize and explore data using the ggplot2 package. Students will become familiar with how to choose the most appropriate data visualization for different data types by adjust aesthetics and chart types. Students will learn Leland Wilkinson’s grammar of graphics approach to data visualization.

Before Class II (week4): Students will complete a makeover challenge assignment and submit prior to the class. This challenge will consist of a poor visualization of data that the students will be asked to improve or come up with different ways in which the data could be visually represented.

 

The following reading materials are for reference.  Please have a look through to familiarize yourself for the class:

**Makeover challenge for Week 4:**
The goal of this exercise is to 'improve' a data visualization that is loose in the wild.  In particular, I want you to think about data visualization principles that we have discussed in class. What are the key messages to illustrate?  What is the most effective type of plot for these data?  How many/much color, annotation, text, lines or shapes should I include in the visualization?  Alternatively, you may decide that the original visualization did not highlight important findings and you think there is a more interesting story in the data to show.

Which dataset/visualization should I choose to makeover? 

-  The best resource for this makover challenge is the community website - "#MakeoverMonday - A weekly social data project".  If you go here: http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/ you will find scores of raw datasets and links to articles that have included visualizations based on the dataset.  Please choose one that interests you and start creating new visualizations !   It may be that just one visualization is sufficient, or you may wish to make several based on the dataset of your choice.   (Note: many of these challenges were taken up by Tableau users who typically make more complex 'dashboard' style visualizations. Don't be discouraged by this. We are interested largely in creating simple, elegant charts similar to those we'd use for research output).

- Alternatively, you may wish to find your own data.  You could retrieve this from anywhere e.g. newspapers, fivethirtyeight's data - https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data , or published research in open-access journal articles.  

If you need any advice on what to choose - please ask Dr Curley.  In week 4, students will present their visualization and design choices in class. Each person will give a quick 5-10 minute presentation on their choices.  To help you - here is a link to one makeover that I completed myself:
