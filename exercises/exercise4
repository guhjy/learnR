## Exercise 4 -  Group Data Carpentry & Visualization Project

In this exercise you will work in groups for two classes.  The goals of this project are to:

- increase your knowledge of working with large, messy datasets in R
- improve data carpentry skills
- develop the ability to discern key information and narratives from raw data
- generate publication quality data visualizations
- produce reproducible data analysis
- work with others in a group to share skills and tasks collaboratively

Before the first class:  Have a look at the datasets below and let me know which you would have a preference on working on - this will help with assigning groups.


In the first class, groups of 2-3 will be assigned.  The first step will be to explore the different datasets and become familiar with data issues.  
Secondly, begin to explore and generate potential research questiosns. This step usually involves producing exploratory visualizations.
You may also wish to bring in related data from other datasets to help with your analysis.

Throughout this class, you can ask me questions if you get stuck. This will provide an opportunity for me to identify which tasks/skills we need to discuss in more detail.

The second class will provide an opportunity to finalize visualizations and code.  This should be reproducible such that anybody can follow your analysis. 
Please post the finished work as a Gist.  You are encouraged to work on the project during the week too !
