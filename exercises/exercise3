## Exercise  - Learn an R Package.

The purpose of this exercise is to learn a new skill by working through examples from a package help guide or vignette.  
You can learn an entire package or just one function from one package.  
What I want you to be able to do is to follow the worked examples and then adapt it for your own data. 

The package you learn could be related to data visualization, data carpentry or statistics.  
Feel free to choose what you are interested in.

Please then write up your example ready to present to class next week. 
If there is a topic you're particularly interested in, but don't know which package to go for - please email me.


Goals:
- you will learn how to use the help guides and vignettes
- you will develop self-learning skills (much required for learning R)
- we all get exposed to a wider variety of cool things that are possible in R
- you will get an opportunity to present to class.
