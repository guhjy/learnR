### Exercise 5 - Reproducible Reports.

The aim of this exercise is to generate your own reproducible report using R.  Please use either RMarkdown or RNotebook (either is fine).

I would like you to generate a reproducible report based on any dataset you wish.  This could be from your own research, a dataset available online, or a dataset from an R package.

The report should include:

- your name (author) and the date in the YAML
- Introduction (text explaining the rationale for choosing the dataset and what you plan to investigate).
- code in R chunks - code you use to process the data and analyze the data in R chunks.
- Data Visualizations:  at least one plot by itself, and at least two plots side-by-side in the same row.
- Table - at least one table showing either raw data or summary data.  The table could be in any format we've used before.
- Summary - a summary paragraph detailing what the plots show and why it's interesting.  
(Please also use text in between code chunks too to describe what you are doing).

Within the RMarkdown/RNotebook file, please include at least 5 of the following using Markdown syntax:

- different header sizes
- a bullet list of text
- bolded or underlined text
- insert an image
- insert a web link
- a mathematical expression
- an inline piece of R code within text that returns an output.
- different font colors using HTML/CSS
 
 
 All of the above are included in the examples I went through in the last class.  Email me if you need any help on them.
